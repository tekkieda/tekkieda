## ðŸš€ My Coding Journey

- **First Steps:**  
  Started with **C** during school (and college), which laid the foundation.
  
- **The Web Era:**  
  Got into **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **jQuery** when forums were the rage.  
  Built themes for **MyBB**, then learned **PHP** for backend magic.  
  Worked extensively with **MyBB** and **WordPress**.

- **The SPA Wave:**  
  Jumped into the madness of modern web:  
  **React.js**, **Vue**, **Svelte**, **Next.js**, and the ever-evolving Node ecosystem.  
  (Honestly, it's a lot, but hey, that's the fun part!)

- **Headless & Beyond:**  
  Learned **Strapi** â€“ probably my favorite backend framework so far.

- **Python:**  
  Dabbled in Python too (not into data science... yet).
